#  Anadolu Efes advises when to hit on thirteen blackjack 

If you enjoy playing casino games, blackjack is probably your favorite. It’s a fast-paced game that pits your skills against the dealer. There are a few basic rules, but blackjack can be a little more complicated than just drawing cards and trying to get as close to 21 as possible. 
The key to winning at blackjack is knowing when to hit and when to stand. But what about when you have 13 in your hand? Should you hit or stand?
Anadolu Efes, one of the top companies in Turkey, has some advice for players. According to them, you should hit on 13 if the dealer is showing a 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7. If the dealer is showing an 8, 9 or 10, you should stand. If the dealer is showing an ace or a face card (J,Q,K), you should hit.
These guidelines will help you make the most of your hand and increase your chances of winning. Keep in mind that blackjack is a game of chance, so there’s no guarantee that following these tips will result in a win. But they can help you make smart decisions about when to hit and when to stand – which can improve your odds of coming out on top.

#  Anadolu Efes releases new blackjack strategy 

On Wednesday, Anadolu Efes announced a new blackjack strategy that it plans to trial in its Turkish casinos. The move comes as the Turkish company looks to boost profits at its casinos and poker rooms.

Under the new strategy, players will be able to exchange half their blackjack bets for a spin on a roulette wheel. If they win the roulette spin, they will keep the prize money and can continue playing blackjack with the rest of their original bet. If they lose the spin, they will lose their entire blackjack bet.

Anadolu Efes said that it trialled the strategy at its Istanbul casino last weekend and that it saw an 80% increase in profits from blackjack games. It added that it plans to roll out the strategy nationwide at all of its casinos in the coming weeks.

The new strategy is likely to prove controversial, with some experts arguing that it gives players an unfair advantage over casinos. However, Anadolu Efes defended the move, saying that it was designed to give players more choice and excitement when playing blackjack.

"This is a new way to play blackjack," a spokesperson for Anadolu Efes said. "We believe that it will be popular with our customers and give them more excitement when playing this classic game."

#  When to hit on thirteen blackjack according to Anadolu Efes 

There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the preferences of the individual and the house rules of the casino. However, there are some general guidelines that can be followed in order to make the most advantageous decision when playing blackjack.

In general, players should hit on a total of thirteen if they are not holding an Ace. This is because the player has a better chance of getting closer to 21 with another card, and an Ace can be counted as either 1 or 11 depending on the context.

However, if the player has an Ace in their hand, they should stand instead of hitting. This is because having an Ace gives them more flexibility in terms of what totals they can achieve and increases their chances of winning.

Players should also keep in mind that blackjack rules can vary from casino to casino. So it is always important to check with the house before playing to find out what their specific policies are.

#  New blackjack strategy from Anadolu Efes 

A new blackjack strategy has been developed by Turkish basketball team Anadolu Efes. The team's head coach, David Blatt, claims that the strategy is based on mathematical principles and can enable players to win more games.

The new strategy is said to involve calculating the odds of each possible outcome of a hand, and then betting accordingly. In particular, it is claimed that the strategy can be used to beat the house edge in blackjack.

The new strategy was developed by Blatt and his team of assistants over a period of two years. The first time it was used in an actual game was earlier this year, when Anadolu Efes played against Croatian team Cedevita in the Euroleague Basketball tournament. The strategy proved successful, with Anadolu Efes winning the game 95-79. 

Since then, the team has continued to use the strategy in other games, with similarly positive results. In a recent match against Italian team EA7 Emporio Armani Milano, for example, Anadolu Efes again emerged victorious – this time by a score of 101-88. 

While some scepticism may be understandable, given that any new blackjack strategy is likely to be met with some resistance from casinos, there is no doubt that Blatt and his team have put in a lot of hard work into developing this system. And if it really does work as well as they say it does, then it could make a big difference to your chances of winning at blackjack.

#  Anadolu Efes reveals secret to winning at blackjack

A team of experts from Anadolu Efes, one of the leading teams in Turkish basketball, recently revealed their secret to winning at blackjack. The team is said to have had great success with the new strategy, which has helped them win several big tournaments in recent years.

The basic principle of the strategy is to bet conservatively and only increase your bets when you have a strong hand. This usually involves only betting a small amount at the beginning, and gradually increasing your bets as the game progresses.

The team also advises players to keep track of the cards that have already been played, in order to get a better idea of what cards are still left in the deck. In addition, players should always be aware of the different blackjack rules and strategies that are being used by the casino.
