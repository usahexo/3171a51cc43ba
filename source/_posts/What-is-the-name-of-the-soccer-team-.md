Whichever type of football you enjoy, one thing remains constant - you need to be able to run fast and jump high! In order to do this, you need good fitness and conditioning. Here are some tips for improving your fitness so that you can perform better at football: 

1) Run sprints: Sprinting is a great way to improve your speed and acceleration. Start by running 10-15 metres at full speed, and then rest for 30 seconds before repeating 2-3 times. As you get fitter, increase the distance that you run. 
2) Jump rope: Jumping rope not only helps improve your cardiovascular fitness, but it also helps increase your jumping height. Start by jumping for 30 seconds, and then rest for 30 seconds before repeating 3-5 times. As you get better, gradually increase the amount of time that you spend jumping rope. 
3) Do squats: Squats are a great exercise for strengthening your thighs and glutes (buttocks). They also help improve your balance and coordination. Start by doing 3 sets of 12 squats, and as you get stronger, gradually increase the number of reps per set. 
4) Lift weights: Lifting weights can help improve your overall strength and power, which will help you when sprinting or tackling someone on offence or defence. start with light weights until you feel comfortable with them, then gradually increase weight as you get stronger

#  How many goals have they scored this season? 

Premier League clubs have now completed the first third of their fixtures for the season. It is a good time to take stock of how each team is doing and see how the table is shaping up.

One of the main talking points so far is the amount of goals being scored. There have been 536 goals in total, at an average of 2.8 per game. This is significantly more than in previous seasons. 

Manchester City currently lead the way with 47 goals, followed closely by Liverpool with 46. Manchester United are a distant third with 27 goals, while Arsenal have scored just 20 times – the lowest tally in the top six. 

The relegation battle looks to be heating up, with Cardiff, Huddersfield and Newcastle all desperately trying to avoid relegation. Fulham and Burnley are also in danger, having scored just 17 and 16 goals respectively. 

So far this season, there have been 227 penalties awarded – an increase of almost 50% on last season’s total. This has led to some controversy, as teams like Liverpool and Manchester City seem to be benefiting from their favourable position on the pitch when it comes to taking penalties. 

Overall, it looks like it could be another entertaining season in the Premier League. With so many goals being scored, there is bound to be plenty more drama to come before the end of the season.
