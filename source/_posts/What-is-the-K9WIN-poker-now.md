# 1: Learn the Poker Hand Rankings

The first step to becoming a successful poker player is understanding the hand rankings. In poker, there are 10 hands that are ranked from best to worst: Royal flush, Straight flush, 4 of a kind, Full house, Flush, Straight, 3 of a kind, 2 pair, 1 pair.

Each hand has a specific ranking and beats all other hands below it on the list. For example, two pair beats a single pair, and a full house beats two pair. It’s important to remember that these rankings only apply when both players have similar hands - if one player has a royal flush and the other player has two jacks, the first player automatically wins.

# 2: Play at a Real Money Table

Once you understand the hand rankings, it’s time to start playing at real money tables. The easiest way to do this is by signing up for an online poker room and depositing some funds into your account. This will give you access to table stakes that range from $0.01/$0.02 all the way up to $100/$200.

Most beginners should start off by playing at lower stakes tables until they feel comfortable with the game rules and strategy. Don’t be afraid to ask questions or seek help from more experienced players at your table - everyone was once a beginner!
