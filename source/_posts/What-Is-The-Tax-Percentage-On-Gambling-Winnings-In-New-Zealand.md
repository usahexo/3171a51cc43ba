This means that you can reduce your overall tax bill by claiming your losses against your wins.

In addition, if you are classed as a “professional gambler” then your gambling income will be subject to a different set of rules. Essentially, professional gamblers are taxed at a higher rate than regular gamblers, as the government sees their activities as being more akin to business endeavours.
