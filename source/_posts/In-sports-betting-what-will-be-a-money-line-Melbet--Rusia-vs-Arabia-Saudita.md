#  In sports betting what will be a money line Melbet: Brasil vs Suiza

In the game of football, the two national teams of Brasil and Suiza will fight for a place in the quarterfinals of the World Cup. The match will take place this Tuesday (2), at the Arena Kazan, in Russia. Currently, bookmakers give an advantage to the Brazilians, who are listed with a line of -235 at Melbet.

The South Americans have been doing well in this World Cup so far. After winning their first two games against Costa Rica (2-0) and Serbia (1-0), they were almost assured of making it to the next stage. In addition, they have one of the best players in history in their squad: Neymar Jr. The only doubt that remains is whether Coach Tite decides to keep him in reserve or start him from the beginning of the match against Switzerland.

The Swiss team has had a more complicated World Cup so far. They qualified for Russia 2018 after winning a play-off against Northern Ireland (1-3 on aggregate), but lost their first game against Brazil 0-1). In their second match, they managed to beat Serbia 2-1 and secure their place in the round of 16. However, they will have to give their all against Brazil if they want to advance to the next stage of the competition.

This promises to be an interesting match between two very good national football teams. Both squads have players that can score goals and make decisive plays. Who do you think will win? Brasil or Switzerland? Make your prediction and bet at Melbet!
