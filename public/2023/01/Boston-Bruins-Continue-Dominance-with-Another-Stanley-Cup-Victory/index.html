<p>This marks the team’s sixth Stanley Cup championship, and they continue to cement their legacy as one of the NHL’s most successful franchises.</p>
<p>Led by veteran players such as Patrice Bergeron and David Krejci, as well as youngsters like Jake DeBrusk and Tuukka Rask, the Bruins were simply too much for the St. Louis Blues to handle.</p>
<p>In a hard-fought seven-game series, the Bruins emerged victorious with a decisive 4-1 victory in game 7.</p>
<p>It was a truly impressive performance by Boston, and they now have a chance to build on this success heading into next season.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Capitals-Finally-Conquer-the-Pittsburgh-Penguins-to-Claim-Lord-Stanley’s-Mug"><a href="#Washington-Capitals-Finally-Conquer-the-Pittsburgh-Penguins-to-Claim-Lord-Stanley’s-Mug" class="headerlink" title="Washington Capitals Finally Conquer the Pittsburgh Penguins to Claim Lord Stanley’s Mug"></a>Washington Capitals Finally Conquer the Pittsburgh Penguins to Claim Lord Stanley’s Mug</h1><p>In a series that has gone back and forth for the last two years, the Washington Capitals have finally emerged victorious over the Pittsburgh Penguins, four games to two.</p>
<p>The question now is: can they keep it going?</p>
<p>After a disappointing end to their season last year, the Capitals were laser focused on taking home the Stanley Cup this year. Led by captain Alex Ovechkin, who was determined to finally win the title that has eluded him for his entire career, the team was solid throughout the playoffs.</p>
<p>The Penguins, on the other hand, were dealing with some internal strife. Star player Evgeni Malkin was reportedly unhappy with his role on the team, and there were rumours of a rift between him and head coach Mike Sullivan. That certainly didn’t help their cause as they were swept out of the playoffs in the first round by the Philadelphia Flyers.</p>
<p>The Capitals got off to a rocky start in this series, losing game one 3-1. But they quickly rallied, winning games two and three by identical 5-2 scores. The Penguins responded by winning game four in overtime 2-1, but Washington shut them down in game five, winning 3-1 to take a 3-2 lead in the series.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh battled back to win game six 5-3, forcing a seventh and final game. But it was all Capitals from start to finish as they cruised to a 6-2 victory to capture their first Stanley Cup championship.</p>
<h1 id="Vegas-Golden-Knights-Prove-to-be-the-Surprise-Team-of-the-Year"><a href="#Vegas-Golden-Knights-Prove-to-be-the-Surprise-Team-of-the-Year" class="headerlink" title="Vegas Golden Knights Prove to be the Surprise Team of the Year"></a>Vegas Golden Knights Prove to be the Surprise Team of the Year</h1><p>The Vegas Golden Knights were not expected to make much of a splash in their inaugural season. However, they have turned out to be one of the best teams in the league and have proved all of their doubters wrong.</p>
<p>When the Golden Knights were formed as an expansion team prior to last season, there were many who doubted their ability to compete in the NHL. After all, it is not easy for new teams to succeed in such a tough league. However, the Golden Knights have managed to exceed expectations and currently sit in first place in the Pacific Division.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for their success has been their strong offense. Led by forwards James Neal and Jonathan Marchessault, the Golden Knights rank third in the NHL in scoring. They have also been solid defensively, allowing just 2.43 goals per game (fourth best in the league).</p>
<p>The Golden Knights are a team that can beat you in a variety of ways. They have stars up front and on defense, as well as a Vezina-caliber goaltender in Marc-Andre Fleury. This balanced attack has allowed them to win games even when they are not playing their best hockey.</p>
<p>The Golden Knights will undoubtedly face stiff competition down the stretch as teams battle for playoff spots. However, they seem poised to make a deep run into the postseason and could very well end up as Stanley Cup champions.</p>
<h1 id="Tampa-Bay-Lightning-Regain-NHL-Supremacy-with-Impressive-Playoffs-Performance"><a href="#Tampa-Bay-Lightning-Regain-NHL-Supremacy-with-Impressive-Playoffs-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Tampa Bay Lightning Regain NHL Supremacy with Impressive Playoffs Performance"></a>Tampa Bay Lightning Regain NHL Supremacy with Impressive Playoffs Performance</h1><p>After winning the Stanley Cup in 2004 and again in 2015, a lot of pressure was on the Tampa Bay Lightning to perform well in the 2017 Stanley Cup Playoffs. With such a successful history, anything less than a trip to the Stanley Cup Finals would have been seen as a disappointment.</p>
<p>Luckily for Bolts fans, the team did not disappoint. After dispatching of the New York Islanders in 5 games and the Boston Bruins in 7 games, the Tampa Bay Lightning found themselves facing off against the Washington Capitals in the Eastern Conference Finals.</p>
<p>In a hard-fought series, the Lightning were able to come out on top, defeating the Capitals in 7 games and advancing to their 3rd Stanley Cup Finals in franchise history.</p>
<p>While they ultimately fell short against the Pittsburgh Penguins (losing 4-2), this was still an impressive showing by Steven Stamkos and company. Led by head coach Jon Cooper, the Tampa Bay Lightning proved that they are once again one of the NHL’s elite teams.</p>
<h1 id="Winnipeg-Jets-Earn-Place-in-History-by-Winning-First-Ever-Stanley-Cup"><a href="#Winnipeg-Jets-Earn-Place-in-History-by-Winning-First-Ever-Stanley-Cup" class="headerlink" title="Winnipeg Jets Earn Place in History by Winning First Ever Stanley Cup"></a>Winnipeg Jets Earn Place in History by Winning First Ever Stanley Cup</h1><p>The Winnipeg Jets have just made history by winning the first ever Stanley Cup in the team’s existence. The Jets were able to pull off the upset against the mighty Nashville Predators, who were the heavy favorites going into the series.</p>
<p>The Jets got off to a shaky start in the playoffs, losing their first two games against the Wild. However, they were able to win four straight games to take down Minnesota and move on to face Nashville.</p>
<p>Nashville had one of the best defenses in the league this season, but Winnipeg was able to find success by scoring goals at critical times. In particular, Nikolaj Ehlers was able to come up big for Winnipeg with some clutch goals.</p>
<p>The final game of the series was a thriller, with Winnipeg rallying from a 3-1 deficit in the third period to win 5-4 in overtime and clinch the Stanley Cup. The Jets players celebrated on the ice with their fans after finally achieving hockey’s ultimate prize.</p>
<p>It has been a long journey for Winnipeg hockey fans, who have waited since 1996 for their team to win a championship. Now that it has finally happened, there is no doubt that Jets fever will be sweeping across Manitoba!</p>
