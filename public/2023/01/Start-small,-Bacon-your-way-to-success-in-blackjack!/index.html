In fact, starting small with this simple strategy can help increase your odds of winning.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works: take a strip of bacon and wrap it around your wager. For example, if you’re betting $10 on the game, then you’ll want to wrap $10 worth of bacon around the strip. If you lose, eat the bacon as a consolation prize. If you win, enjoy the spoils and cook up another piece of bacon to celebrate!</p>
<p>This strategy might not seem like much, but over time it can add up. And who doesn’t love the taste of bacon?</p>
<h1 id="Bacon-the-key-to-unlocking-blackjack-profits"><a href="#Bacon-the-key-to-unlocking-blackjack-profits" class="headerlink" title="Bacon the key to unlocking blackjack profits!"></a>Bacon the key to unlocking blackjack profits!</h1><p>There’s a reason bacon is so popular, and it has nothing to do with being unhealthy. It’s delicious! From breakfast all the way to dinner, this cured meat can be added to any dish for a salty, smoky flavor that everyone loves.</p>
<p>The next time you’re playing blackjack, consider adding bacon as a topping. Believe it or not, this simple addition could be the key to unlocking greater profits! Here’s how it works:</p>
<p>Bacon is a high-calorie food. This means that it takes up more space on your plate than other foods. When you add bacon to your blackjack game, you are making room for fewer bets. This gives you more chances to win, and makes the games last longer so you can make even more money.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s no need to stop at bacon. You can add other high-calorie foods to your blackjack game as well. Cheese, sausage, and even macaroni and cheese will work well. Just make sure that you have enough room on your plate for all of these indulgent foods!</p>

In this article, we are going to show you how to use Bacon to get an edge over the house and consistently win!</p>
<h1 id="The-basics-of-blackjack"><a href="#The-basics-of-blackjack" class="headerlink" title="The basics of blackjack"></a>The basics of blackjack</h1><p>Blackjack is a card game that is played between a player and a dealer. The objective of the game is to achieve a hand total that is closer to 21 than the dealer’s hand total, without exceeding 21. Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value, while King, Queen and Jack are each worth 10. An Ace can be worth 1 or 11, depending on what would make the best hand.</p>
<p>After the player has been dealt their two cards, they can choose to hit (take another card) or stand (end their turn). If their hand total goes over 21, they bust and lose the hand. If the dealer has a hand total of 17 or more, they must stand, regardless of what the player does. If the dealer has a hand total of 16 or less, they must hit.</p>
<p>When both the player and dealer have completed their hands, the higher total wins. If both totals are the same, it is called a push and no one wins or loses money.</p>
<h1 id="The-basic-strategy-for-blackjack"><a href="#The-basic-strategy-for-blackjack" class="headerlink" title="The basic strategy for blackjack"></a>The basic strategy for blackjack</h1><p>The basic strategy for blackjack is a set of rules that players can follow in order to make better decisions while playing the game. It takes into account all possible situations that can arise during a game of blackjack, including whether to hit or stand, when to double down and when to split pairs. Following these rules will give you the best chance possible of winning at blackjack!</p>
<p>For most situations, you should always hit if your hand total is less than 17 and stand if your hand total is 17 or more. However, there are some exceptions to this rule - for example, you should always stand if your hand total is 11 or more. You can find a full list of basic strategy tips on our website: [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.baconbingo.com/blackjack-basics/]">https://www.baconbingo.com/blackjack-basics/]</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Using-Bacon-to-beat-the-house-odds"><a href="#Using-Bacon-to-beat-the-house-odds" class="headerlink" title="Using Bacon to beat the house odds"></a>Using Bacon to beat the house odds</h1><p>Now that you understand how to play blackjack and how to follow the basic strategy guidelines, it’s time to learn how to use Bacon for an edge over the casino! Bacon works by giving you information about what cards have already been played in the deck - this information allows you make better decisions while playing blackjack and gives you an advantage over the house.</p>
<p>To start using Bacon at blackjack tables, simply open up our software and select a table that accepts Bacon play. Once you have opened up a table, click on “Deal” button to begin your game round. After your first two cards have been dealt, our software will provide you with information about which cards have been played so far in the round (this information is displayed in green).</p>
<p>  (5) Now that we know which cards have already been played, we can start making better decisions while playing our hand! For example: we know that there is only one 3 left in the deck (as shown in image), so if we are holding a 3 ourselves we should definitely double down! This type of strategic decision-making is where Bacon really comes into its own - by using our software at blackjack tables, you can give yourself an edge over the casino and increase your chances of winning!</p>
<h1 id="Keep-it-simple-with-Bacon-and-blackjack-profits-will-follow"><a href="#Keep-it-simple-with-Bacon-and-blackjack-profits-will-follow" class="headerlink" title="Keep it simple with Bacon and blackjack profits will follow!"></a>Keep it simple with Bacon and blackjack profits will follow!</h1><p>There is no need to overcomplicate things when it comes to making money. In fact, by keeping things simple you can actually increase your chances of profiting from your pursuits! This is certainly the case with bacon and blackjack, two activities that can be enjoyed separately or together for maximum profitability.</p>
<p>When it comes to cooking bacon, the simpler the better. Too much fussing with the bacon will only lead to overcooked strips that are less than appetizing. For perfect bacon every time, simply place the strips on a baking sheet in a single layer and bake at 400 degrees for 15-20 minutes. No flipping or basting required!</p>
<p>For those looking to make a little extra money through blackjack, keep things simple as well. There is no need to learn complex counting systems or engage in risky betting strategies. In fact, all you really need is basic knowledge of the game and some common sense betting tactics. One such strategy is splitting pairs – when you are dealt two cards of the same rank, you can split them up into two hands and bet on each one independently. This increases your chances of winning while also doubling your potential profits.</p>
<p>So next time you are looking for a fun and profitable activity, think simple – bacon and blackjack are a great combination!</p>
