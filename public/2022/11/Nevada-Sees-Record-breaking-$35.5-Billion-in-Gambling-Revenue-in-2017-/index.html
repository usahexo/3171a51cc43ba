            <h1 id="Nevada-Sees-Record-breaking-35-5-Billion-in-Gambling-Revenue-in-2017"><a href="#Nevada-Sees-Record-breaking-35-5-Billion-in-Gambling-Revenue-in-2017" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Sees Record-breaking $35.5 Billion in Gambling Revenue in 2017"></a>Nevada Sees Record-breaking $35.5 Billion in Gambling Revenue in 2017</h1><p>The gambling industry in Nevada is booming, with record-breaking $35.5 billion in gambling revenue in 2017. This is an increase of 5.5% over the previous year, and is more than double the amount brought in by casinos in New Jersey.</p>
<p> much of this growth can be attributed to the legalization of online gambling in Nevada in 2013. This has allowed casinos to attract new players from around the country and world, who can now access casino games from their computers or mobile devices.</p>
<p>The industry also continues to grow thanks to the popularity of new casino games such as slot machines and blackjack. In particular, there has been a surge in the popularity of “progressive” slot machines, which offer jackpots that can reach into the millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Casinos are also benefiting from a strong economy and rising consumer confidence. This has led to increased spending by tourists visiting Las Vegas and other Nevada cities.</p>
<p>While there are concerns that the growth of online gambling could lead to a decline in traditional casino revenues, thus far there is no evidence that this is happening. In fact, with more states legalizing online gambling, it is likely that Nevada’s gambling industry will continue to grow in years to come.</p>
<h1 id="Oregon’s-Casinos-Bring-in-1B-in-Revenue-Over-Past-Year"><a href="#Oregon’s-Casinos-Bring-in-1B-in-Revenue-Over-Past-Year" class="headerlink" title="Oregon’s Casinos Bring in $1B in Revenue Over Past Year"></a>Oregon’s Casinos Bring in $1B in Revenue Over Past Year</h1><p>Oregon’s casinos brought in a combined $1 billion in revenue over the past year, according to data from the Oregon Lottery.</p>
<p>The Golden Dragon Casino in Cottage Grove was the top earner, generating $197 million in revenue. The slots-only casino is owned by the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians.</p>
<p>Second place went to Seven Feathers Casino Resort in Canyonville, which generated $172 million in revenue. The casino is owned by the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Indian Tribe.</p>
<p>Rounding out the top five were Spirit Mountain Casino in Grand Ronde ($152 million), ilani Casino Resort near Ridgefield, Washington ($119 million), and Silverton Casino Lodge in Silverton ($115 million).</p>
<p>Oregon’s 29 casinos employ just over 5,000 people and paid out more than $330 million in wages and benefits last year.</p>
<h1 id="What-Effect-Does-Gambling-Have-on-the-Workplace"><a href="#What-Effect-Does-Gambling-Have-on-the-Workplace" class="headerlink" title="What Effect Does Gambling Have on the Workplace?"></a>What Effect Does Gambling Have on the Workplace?</h1><p>Gambling has long been a part of the American workplace. From the days of Charles Ponzi, who is widely credited with inventing modern-day pyramid schemes, to the recent investigations of insider trading on Wall Street, gambling has always been a part of business. And while many people believe that gambling can have a negative effect on the workplace, there is evidence that suggest that, at least in some cases, gambling may have a positive effect on productivity and profits.</p>
<p>In fact, some have argued that gambling can be good for businesses because it promotes risk taking and innovation. Gambling can also lead to greater employee cooperation and socialization, which can boost morale and productivity. And while there is certainly a danger of employees becoming addicted to gambling, in most cases the potential benefits appear to outweigh the potential risks.</p>
<p>Of course, this is not to say that gambling should be encouraged in the workplace. In many cases, it may be best to ban all forms of gambling altogether. But in some instances, allowing limited forms of gambling may actually help businesses achieve their goals.</p>
<h1 id="Study-Shows-Gambling-Can-Negatively-Affect-Workplace-Productivity"><a href="#Study-Shows-Gambling-Can-Negatively-Affect-Workplace-Productivity" class="headerlink" title="Study Shows Gambling Can Negatively Affect Workplace Productivity"></a>Study Shows Gambling Can Negatively Affect Workplace Productivity</h1><p>A recent study published in the journal “Addiction” has shown that gambling can have a negative effect on workplace productivity. The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Amsterdam and involved interviews with 1,040 employees working in the service and retail sectors.</p>
<p>The study found that employees who gambled were more likely to miss work, be late for work, and take unauthorized breaks from work. They were also more likely to experience problems with concentration and motivation.</p>
<p>Gambling can be a very addictive behavior, and it’s important for employers to be aware of the potential negative consequences it can have on their workforce. steps can be taken to discourage gambling among employees, such as implementing policies prohibiting gambling at work or during work hours.</p>

<p>Plainridge Park is now the most successful casino in Massachusetts, surpassing MGM Springfield, which generated $191.2 million in revenue during its first year of operation.</p>
<p>The commission’s report also showed that Plainridge Park created 1,711 jobs during its first year, with an average salary of $33,898. The casino paid out $85.6 million in wages and benefits to its employees during that time period.</p>
<p>Finally, the casino generated $14.5 million in taxes for the state during its first year of operation.</p>
