            <h1 id="Golden-Engines-Game-Could-Lead-to-Casino-Gambling-Boom-in-Florida"><a href="#Golden-Engines-Game-Could-Lead-to-Casino-Gambling-Boom-in-Florida" class="headerlink" title="Golden Engines Game Could Lead to Casino Gambling Boom in Florida"></a>Golden Engines Game Could Lead to Casino Gambling Boom in Florida</h1><p>Casinos are a big business. In Florida, they’re a $2.5 billion industry, and they employs tens of thousands of people. In order to keep the business running, casinos need new customers, and they’re hoping that a new game will bring in the crowds.</p>
<p>The game is called Golden Engines, and it’s based on the old slot machines. The difference is that players can now bet on the games, just like they would in a regular casino. This has sparked excitement among casino owners, who are hoping for a gambling boom in the state.</p>
<p>The problem is that there’s no real evidence that this game will be any more popular than slots or other casino games. It’s possible that it will take off, but it’s also possible that it will fail. If it does fail, then it could be costly for the casinos involved.</p>
<p>It’s too early to tell whether or not this game will be a success, but casino owners are counting on it. If it does well, then it could lead to a major gambling boom in Florida.</p>
<h1 id="Golden-Engines-Game-Could-Expand-Casino-Gambling-in-Florida"><a href="#Golden-Engines-Game-Could-Expand-Casino-Gambling-in-Florida" class="headerlink" title="Golden Engines Game Could Expand Casino Gambling in Florida"></a>Golden Engines Game Could Expand Casino Gambling in Florida</h1><p>The Miami Herald reported this past weekend that the Seminole Tribe of Florida and its partner, game developer Golden Engine Gaming, are moving ahead with plans for a massive casino in Immokalee. The $2 billion project would encompass an area of almost 2,000 acres and include a hotel, spa, and 200,000 square feet of gaming space.</p>
<p>This is the latest development in what has been a flurry of casino gambling announcements in Florida over the past year. In South Florida, Genting Group has proposed a $3 billion resort casino in downtown Miami, while Las Vegas Sands has revealed plans for a $2.5 billion casino resort near Orlando. And now there is word of another major project coming to Immokalee.</p>
<p>What does all this activity mean for casino gambling in Florida?</p>
<p>It’s too soon to say for certain, but it certainly looks as if the state is on the verge of a major expansion in casino gambling. This could be good news for both the casinos and the state government, which stands to generate significant revenue from licensing fees and taxes.</p>
<p>But it’s also possible that the influx of new casinos could hurt business at existing properties. It will be important for the state government to monitor the industry closely to make sure that there is fair competition among the casinos.</p>
<p>Overall, though, there is reason to be optimistic about casino gambling in Florida. The state already has a strong tourism industry, and now it appears that casinos are poised to become an even bigger part of that mix.</p>
<h1 id="Golden-Engines-Game-May-Spur-Casino-Expansion-in-Florida"><a href="#Golden-Engines-Game-May-Spur-Casino-Expansion-in-Florida" class="headerlink" title="Golden Engines Game May Spur Casino Expansion in Florida"></a>Golden Engines Game May Spur Casino Expansion in Florida</h1><p> States eyeing the potential tax windfall from legalizing casino gambling are moving quickly to pass bills and set up regulations. The anticipation of jobs and revenue is driving the effort, with Pennsylvania one of the latest to join the pack.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s Senate approved a plan this week that would legalize casino gambling and create new taxes on the industry. The state joins at least 10 others with active legislatures considering expanding casino gambling this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p>
<p>Most of the proposals would authorize new casinos or slot machines, or both. New Jersey, for example, is looking to allow two new casinos in the northern part of the state, and West Virginia is considering whether to add table games to its five casinos.</p>
<p>The moves come as states face increased competition for revenue from legalized gambling from neighboring states and Native American tribes. Casino gambling already is legal in 39 states, plus Washington, D.C., according to NCSL.</p>
<p>States are also eager to cash in on a growing industry. The U.S. casino gambling market generated $37.34 billion in revenue in 2016, up 2 percent from 2015, according to gaming research firm H2 Gambling Capital.</p>

<h1 id="Golden-Engines-Game-Spurs-Casino-gambling-interest-in-Florida"><a href="#Golden-Engines-Game-Spurs-Casino-gambling-interest-in-Florida" class="headerlink" title="Golden Engines Game Spurs Casino gambling interest in Florida"></a>Golden Engines Game Spurs Casino gambling interest in Florida</h1><p>The popularity of casino gambling in the state of Florida is on the rise, thanks in part to the new Golden Engines game at the Seminole Hard Rock Casino in Hollywood. The game, which simulates a horse race, has players betting on different horses to win, place or show.</p>
<p>Since its introduction, interest in casino gambling in the Sunshine State has skyrocketed, with more people visiting casinos and spending more money while there. In fact, revenue from slot machines and other casino games at the state’s seven tribal casinos went up by nearly $120 million in 2018 – a 6 percent increase over the previous year.</p>
<p>Much of that increase can be attributed to the popularity of Golden Engines, which was introduced at the Seminole Hard Rock Hollywood in January 2018. Not surprisingly, Seminole Tribe of Florida Chairman Marcellus Osceola Jr. is quite pleased with how things are going.</p>
<p>“Our gaming products are always evolving and being updated with the latest and greatest technology available so that we can offer our guests a unique experience each time they visit one of our properties,” said Osceola Jr.</p>
<p>The introduction of Golden Engines has also led to an increase in jobs at Florida’s casinos, as well as greater investment in those businesses. For instance, the Seminole Hard Rock Hollywood has added about 100 new jobs since the game was introduced.</p>
<h1 id="Golden-Engines-Game-Ignites-Casino-Gambling-Debate-in-Florida"><a href="#Golden-Engines-Game-Ignites-Casino-Gambling-Debate-in-Florida" class="headerlink" title="Golden Engines Game Ignites Casino Gambling Debate in Florida"></a>Golden Engines Game Ignites Casino Gambling Debate in Florida</h1><p>It’s not often that a new gambling game catches the attention of lawmakers in Florida, but that is exactly what has happened with Golden Engines, a new slot game that has quickly become popular in casinos across the state.</p>
<p>The game is based on the stock market, and players can win real money by betting on stocks and making correct predictions about their performance. While some lawmakers are hailing Golden Engines as a new way to generate tax revenue for the state, others are concerned that it will lead to increased gambling addiction and crime.</p>
<p>A bill has already been filed in the legislature that would prohibit the use of Golden Engines in Florida casinos, and the debate is likely to continue for months to come. Whatever happens, it’s clear that this new game is stirring up a lot of excitement - and controversy - in the Sunshine State.</p>
